# Magnetoresistive RAM for error resilient XNOR-Nets

Binarized Convolutional Neural Network architectures were trained using error-prone activations tested without errors to study the resilience of the training process. The ability to operate with high BERs is critical for reducing power consumption in existing hardware and for facilitating emerging memory technologies. We discuss how operating at moderate BER can enable Magnetoresistive RAM with higher endurance, speed and density. Detailed discussion in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10927
