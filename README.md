# ConvNets_with_activation_errors
Binarized Convolutional Neural Network architectures (here only NiN) were trained on a variety of datasets (here only CIFAR-1) using error-prone activations and tested them without errors to study the resilience of the training process. Details in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10927
